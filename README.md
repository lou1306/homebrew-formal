# homebrew-formal (reloaded)

This is a fork of [`mht208/formal`](https://github.com/mht208/homebrew-formal),
a Homebrew tap for formal methods tools that are missing in the official
Homebrew repository.

# Installation

Install Homebrew and then execute the following command:

  $ brew tap lou1306/formal

# A note on this fork

I am grateful to mht208 for their great work on the original tap, and for
accepting my pull requests in the past. At the moment I still plan to keep this
fork compatible with it, and send pull requests upstream regularly.

At the same time, I want to build a modern, dependable tap for macOS users
interested in formal methods. This requires a series of extensive changes that
the PR system of contribution cannot accommodate with ease.

Thus, the new plan is to:

* Equip the repository with a LICENSE, which a) fully acknowledges mht208's
  work and b) empowers new contributors to use and modify the tap;
* Add instructions for potential contributors to foster collaboration and
  ensure high-quality formulas;
* Progressively update old formulas so they comply with those same quality
  guidelines.
